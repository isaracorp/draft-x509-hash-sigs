1.  Introduction

   The Hierarchical Signature System (HSS) is described in
   [I-D.mcgrew-hash-sigs].

   The eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS), and its multi-tree
   variant XMSS^MT, are described in [RFC8391].

   These signature algorithms are based on well-studied Hash Based
   Signature (HBS) schemes, which can withstand known attacks using
   quantum computers.  They combine Merkle Trees with One Time Signature
   (OTS) schemes in order to create signature systems which can sign a
   large but limited number of messages per private key.  The private
   keys are stateful; a key's state must be updated and persisted after
   signing to prevent reuse of OTS keys.  If an OTS key is reused,
   cryptographic security is not guaranteed for that key.

   Due to the statefulness of the private key and the limited number of
   signatures that can be created, these signature algorithms might not
   be appropriate for use in interactive protocols.  While the right
   selection of algorithm parameters would allow a private key to sign a

Internet-Draft       Hash-Based Signatures for X.509        October 2018


   virtually unbounded number of messages (e.g. 2^60), this is at the
   cost of a larger signature size and longer signing time.  Since these
   algorithms are already known to be secure against quantum attacks,
   and because roots of trust are generally long-lived and can take
   longer to be deployed than end-entity certificates, these signature
   algorithms are more appropriate to be used in root and subordinate CA
   certificates.  They are also appropriate in non-interactive contexts
   such as code signing.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Subject Public Key Algorithms

   Certificates conforming to [RFC5280] can convey a public key for any
   public key algorithm.  The certificate indicates the algorithm
   through an algorithm identifier.  An algorithm identifier consists of
   an OID and optional parameters.

   In this document, we define two new OIDs for identifying the
   different hash-based signature algorithms.  A third OID is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-hash-sig] and repeated here for convenience.  For
   all of the OIDs, the parameters MUST be absent.

2.1.  HSS Public Keys

   The object identifier and public key algorithm identifier for HSS is
   defined in [I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-hash-sig].  The definitions are
   repeated here for reference.

   The object identifier for an HSS public key is id-alg-hss-lms-
   hashsig:

      id-alg-hss-lms-hashsig  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1)
         member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs9(9)
         smime(16) alg(3) 17 }

   Note that the id-alg-hss-lms-hashsig algorithm identifier is also
   referred to as id-alg-mts-hashsig.  This synonym is based on the
   terminology used in an early draft of the document that became
   [I-D.mcgrew-hash-sigs].

   The HSS public key's properties are defined as follows:

Internet-Draft       Hash-Based Signatures for X.509        October 2018


      pk-HSS-LMS-HashSig PUBLIC-KEY ::= {
         IDENTIFIER id-alg-hss-lms-hashsig
         KEY HSS-LMS-HashSig-PublicKey
         PARAMS ARE absent
         CERT-KEY-USAGE
            { digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyCertSign, cRLSign } }

      HSS-LMS-HashSig-PublicKey ::= OCTET STRING

   [I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-hash-sig] contains more information on the
   contents and format of an HSS public key.

2.2.  XMSS Public Keys

   The object identifier for an XMSS public key is id-xmss:

      id-xmss  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { itu-t(0)
         identified-organization(4) etsi(0) reserved(127)
         etsi-identified-organization(0) isara(15) algorithms(1)
         asymmetric(1) xmss(13) 0 }

   The XMSS public key's properties are defined as follows:

      pk-xmss PUBLIC-KEY ::= {
         IDENTIFIER id-xmss
         KEY XMSS-PublicKey
         PARAMS ARE absent
         CERT-KEY-USAGE
            { digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyCertSign, cRLSign } }

      XMSS-PublicKey ::= OCTET STRING

   The format of an XMSS public key is is formally defined using XDR
   [RFC4506] and is defined in Appendix B.3 of [RFC8391].  In
   particular, the first 4 bytes represents the big-ending encoding of
   the XMSS algorithm type.

2.3.  XMSS^MT Public Keys

   The object identifier for an XMSS^MT public key is id-xmssmt:

      id-xmssmt  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { itu-t(0)
         identified-organization(4) etsi(0) reserved(127)
         etsi-identified-organization(0) isara(15) algorithms(1)
         asymmetric(1) xmssmt(14) 0 }

   The XMSS^MT public key's properties are defined as follows:

Internet-Draft       Hash-Based Signatures for X.509        October 2018


      pk-xmssmt PUBLIC-KEY ::= {
         IDENTIFIER id-xmssmt
         KEY XMSSMT-PublicKey
         PARAMS ARE absent
         CERT-KEY-USAGE
            { digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyCertSign, cRLSign } }

      XMSSMT-PublicKey ::= OCTET STRING

   The format of an XMSS^MT public key is is formally defined using XDR
   [RFC4506] and is defined in Appendix C.3 of [RFC8391].  In
   particular, the first 4 bytes represents the big-ending encoding of
   the XMSS^MT algorithm type.

3.  Key Usage Bits

   The intended application for the key is indicated in the keyUsage
   certificate extension.

   If the keyUsage extension is present in an end-entity certificate
   that indicates id-xmss or id-xmssmt in SubjectPublicKeyInfo, then the
   keyUsage extension MUST contain one or both of the following values:

      nonRepudiation; and
      digitalSignature.

   If the keyUsage extension is present in a certification authority
   certificate that indicates id-xmss or id-xmssmt, then the keyUsage
   extension MUST contain one or more of the following values:

      nonRepudiation;
      digitalSignature;
      keyCertSign; and
      cRLSign.

   [I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-hash-sig] defines the key usage for id-alg-hss-
   lms-hashsig, which is the same as for the keys above.

4.  Signature Algorithms

   Certificates and CRLs conforming to [RFC5280] may be signed with any
   public key signature algorithm.  The certificate or CRL indicates the
   algorithm through an algorithm identifier which appears in the
   signatureAlgorithm field within the Certificate or CertificateList.
   This algorithm identifier is an OID and has optionally associated
   parameters.  This section identifies algorithm identifiers that MUST
   be used in the signatureAlgorithm field in a Certificate or
   CertificateList.

Internet-Draft       Hash-Based Signatures for X.509        October 2018


   Signature algorithms are always used in conjunction with a one-way
   hash function.

   This section identifies OIDs for HSS, XMSS, and XMSS^MT.  When these
   algorithm identifiers appear in the algorithm field as an
   AlgorithmIdentifier, the encoding MUST omit the parameters field.
   That is, the AlgorithmIdentifier SHALL be a SEQUENCE of one
   component, one of the OIDs defined below.

   The data to be signed (e.g., the one-way hash function output value)
   is directly signed by the hash-based signature algorithms without any
   additional formatting necessary.  The signature values is a large
   OCTET STRING.  This signature value is then ASN.1 encoded as a BIT
   STRING and included in the Certificate or CertificateList in the
   signature field.

4.1.  HSS Signature Algorithm

   The ASN.1 OIDs used to specify that an HSS signature was generated on
   a SHA-256 or SHA-512 hash of an object are, respectively:

         identified-organization(4) etsi(0) reserved(127)
         etsi-identified-organization(0) isara(15) algorithms(1)
         asymmetric(1) hss(12) 2 }

   generated on a SHA-256 or SHA-512 hash of an object are,
   respectively:

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  Algorithm Security Considerations

   The cryptographic security of the signatures generated by the
   algorithms mentioned in this document depends only on the hash
   algorithms used within the signature algorithms and the pre-hash
   algorithm used to create an X.509 certificate's message digest.
   Grover's algorithm [Grover96] is a quantum search algorithm which
   gives a quadratic improvement in search time to brute-force pre-image
   attacks.  The results of [BBBV97] show that this improvement is



Van Geest & Fluhrer      Expires April 16, 2019                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft       Hash-Based Signatures for X.509        October 2018


   optimal, however [Fluhrer17] notes that Grover's algorithm doesn't
   parallelize well.  Thus, given a bounded amount of time to perform
   the attack and using a conservative estimate of the performance of a
   real quantum computer, the pre-image quantum security of SHA-256 is
   closer to 190 bits.  All parameter sets for the signature algorithms
   in this document currently use SHA-256 internally and thus have at
   least 128 bits of quantum pre-image resistance, or 190 bits using the
   security assumptions in [Fluhrer17].

   [Zhandry15] shows that hash collisions can be found using an
   algorithm with a lower bound on the number of oracle queries on the
   order of 2^(n/3) on the number of bits, however [DJB09] demonstrates
   that the quantum memory requirements would be much greater.
   Therefore a pre-hash using SHA-256 would have at least 128 bits of
   quantum collision-resistance as well as the pre-image resistance
   mentioned in the previous paragraph.

   Given the quantum collision and pre-image resistance of SHA-256
   estimated above, the algorithm identifiers hss-with-SHA256, xmss-
   with-SHA256 and xmssmt-with-SHA256 defined in this document provide
   128 bits or more of quantum security.  This is believed to be secure
   enough to protect X.509 certificates for well beyond any reasonable
   certificate lifetime, although the SHA-512 variants could be used if
   there are any doubts.

   The algorithm identifiers hss-with-SHA512, xmss-with-SHA512 and
   xmssmt-with-SHA512 are defined in order to provide 256 bits of
   classical security (256 bits of brute-force pre-image resistance with
   the signature algorithms' SHA-256 and 256 bits of birthday attack
   collision resistance with the SHA-512 pre-hash).

6.2.  Implementation Security Considerations

   Implementations must protect the private keys.  Compromise of the
   private keys may result in the ability to forge signatures.  Along
   with the private key, the implementation must keep track of which
   leaf nodes in the tree have been used.  Loss of integrity of this
   tracking data can cause an one-time key to be used more than once.
   As a result, when a private key and the tracking data are stored on
   non-volatile media or stored in a virtual machine environment, care
   must be taken to preserve confidentiality and integrity.

   The generation of private keys relies on random numbers.  The use of
   inadequate pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) to generate these
   values can result in little or no security.  An attacker may find it
   much easier to reproduce the PRNG environment that produced the keys,
   searching the resulting small set of possibilities, rather than brute
   force searching the whole key space.  The generation of quality

   random numbers is difficult.  [RFC4086] offers important guidance in
   this area.

   The generation of hash-based signatures also depends on random
   numbers.  While the consequences of an inadequate pseudo-random
   number generator (PRNGs) to generate these values is much less severe
   than the generation of private keys, the guidance in [RFC4086]
   remains important.
