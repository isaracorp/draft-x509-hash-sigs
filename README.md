# draft-x509-hash-sigs
HSS and XMSS in X.509

Do all work in draft-vangeest-x509-hash-sigs-working.xml, we'll copy it to draft-vangeest-x509-hash-sigs-NN.xml and create draft-vangeest-x509-hash-sigs-NN.txt when we submit a new version of the draft.

Do not edit txt files directly, generate them from xml using xml2rfc.
e.g.
xml2rfc draft-vangeest-x509-hash-sigs-working.xml.xml -b draft-vangeest-x509-hash-sigs-working.xml --text
